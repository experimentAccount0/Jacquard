General Usage
=============
``usage: jacquard <SUBCOMMAND> [ARGUMENTS] [OPTIONS]``

For help on a specific command:

``jacquard <SUBCOMMAND> -h'``


Sub-Commands
------------
**translate**
: Accepts a directory of VCF files (and VarScan high confidence files). Creates 
a new directory of VCF files, adding Jacquard-specific FORMAT tags to each VCF 
record.

**merge**
: Accepts a directory of VCF files and returns a single merged VCF file.

**summarize**
: Accepts a Jacquard-tagged VCF file and creates a new file, adding summary 
fields. 

**expand**
: Converts a VCF file into an tab-delimited file in a tabular format which would
be better suited than a VCF file for analysis and visualization in R, Pandas, 
Excel, or another third party application.

Input File Conventions
----------------------
Jacquard assumes that the first element of the filename is a patient identifier.

   patientA-113.mutect.vcf

   patientA-113.strelka.snv.vcf

   patientA-113.strelka.indel.vcf

This set of three files all have the same patient identifier (patientA-113) to
represent the same tumor-normal pair; these files will be combined into a
single pair of tumor-normals in the merged VCF. See merge for more details.


To translate a specific VCF dialect, Jacquard determines the source variant
caller based on the VCF metaheaders. For this reason it is essential that you
preserve all metaheaders in the source VCF.


For a specific source VCF, Jacquard automatically determines the tumor and
normal samples based on the column header and the metaheaders.


Notes
-----
The Jacquard-produced output VCFs are fully compliant VCF files that can be
easily loaded into an external program, such as an annotation tool.


Jacquard first writes output files to a temporary directory and only copies the
files upon successful completion of each subcommand.


Error, warning, and info messages are written to console and log file. Debug
messages are only written to the log file unless logger is initialized as
verbose (in which case debug is also echoed to console).
