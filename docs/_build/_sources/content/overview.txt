Exome sequencing is an emerging technology for classifying genomic variants. Most exome sequencing pipelines use variant callers which will generate files in the VCF format. However, variant callers use differing dialects to report their results, and most exome sequencing pipelines will require the use of two or more variant callers to complete an analysis. Jacquard is a tool for combining VCFs across multiple somatic variant callers in an informed manner to generate a comprehensive file with information from these callers, in a common dialect. Effectively combining VCF results from multiple callers is cumbersome without a dedicated script, and Jacquard aims to address this issue. Jacquard is a collection of separate modules that can be used individually but also can be run together as a pipeline.
